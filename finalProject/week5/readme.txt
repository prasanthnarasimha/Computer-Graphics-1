This scene has a cube with umass lowell logo as its texture.
We also have some trees lying around generated randomly. 
You can move around the scene using left click and drag.
To move the cube just right click anywhere.
The texture of the floor does not look like grass but I tried to make it look like grass.
In my next submission, I will add proper texture to the floor so that it looks like we're in an open field.
I will also add tree collision in my next submission.
I will try to add keyboard controls to the cube as well in my next submission.
