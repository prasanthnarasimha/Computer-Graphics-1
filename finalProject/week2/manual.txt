After opening the week2.html through finalProject's home page, you can see an option to change the background color. You can play around with that feature.

After that, we have few buttons like 3D house, front view, side view, top view and 3d cube object. You can click on one button at a time to see the respective 3d transformations. If you click on the same button twice, the respective svg disappears.

Below that, we have perspective projections of an object cube.
