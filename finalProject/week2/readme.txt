I have created perspective projections of an object cube. I also coded 3d transformations of the house model that I created during previous week's submission.
List of Files:
    1. week2.html
    2. app.js
    3. style1.css
    4. gl-matrix.js (reference: https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix)
    5. manual.txt

I used reference 3 to code 3D transformations

I also coded a 3D object cube in WebGL. I have used gl-matrix.js to compute complex matrix calculations. Next week, I will add texture to the object cube that I created. 
I will also try to add lighting and shadow transformations in the coming week's submissions.
