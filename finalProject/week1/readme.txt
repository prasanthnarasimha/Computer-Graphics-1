    week1.html - Week 1 progress is coded in this file. It makes use of app.js

In this week, I have created front, side, top and isometric views of a house. I have given the option for the user to tranform the object in each view. The instructions are pretty basic. All the transformations are given under each view with a slider. Adjust the slider to get the desired transformation.

*New feature*: New feature I experimented this week is the ability for the user to change the background to any color. You can find this feature at the top of the page. I have used reference 1 to get this to work.

I have also experimented with svg animations. I would like to improve on them in the coming week.
